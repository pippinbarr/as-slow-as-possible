## Asteroids

- Player-asteroid collision
- Player explosions that would look right in slow motion? Recompose player at death out of multiple triangles for instance? Sounds like a horrible math experience, but could be worthwhile.
- Add a flame to the back of the player when accelerating (could tie to progress toward max velocity for visual effect? Can it be redish? If so should I have a highlight colour throughout for just one element? Ball, flame, something?)
- Add timer
- Improve asteroid breakup positioning and velocity
- Add timing limit to missiles (at least create the same spatial cap if you spam? How to signal the missile is not ready to fire? Attach it to the front of the ship all the time and fire? Something else?)
