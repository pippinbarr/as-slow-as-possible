# To-dos

## Pong

- How to handle the reset when someone misses?

## Breakout

- How to handle the reset when someone misses?
- Game over? Could you ever win?
 
## Asteroids
- ~~Add a flame to the back of the player when accelerating (could tie to progress toward max velocity for visual effect? Can it be redish? If so should I have a highlight colour throughout for just one element? Ball, flame, something?)~~
- ~~Add timer~~

- Player-asteroid collision
- Player explosions that would look right in slow motion? Recompose player at death out of multiple triangles for instance? Sounds like a horrible math experience, but could be worthwhile. (Or maybe I just create a particle effect for it, a bit easier...)
- Improve asteroid breakup positioning and velocity
- Add timing limit to missiles (at least create the same spatial cap if you spam? How to signal the missile is not ready to fire? Attach it to the front of the ship all the time and fire? Something else?)

## Missile Command
- ~~Targeting the x is a bit off~~
- ~~Explosions aren't disappearing~~
- ~~Missiles appear inside launchers which looks stupid to my eye~~

- Maximum number of missiles? I think so - but then how to indicate?
- Handling game over?
- What is the right speed for this thing?
- Launcher shape? Check original game.
- Do get a line going behind the enemy missiles
