# To-dos

## Difficulty levels

- That rather lovely idea of difficulty being reflected in either how long you play or how slow it is or both...

## Sound/music

- Right?

## Pong

- ~~How to handle the reset when someone misses? One weird option is simply not to (per Missile Command? Seems really weird but also refocuses what the game means?)~~
- ~~Add spin off the paddle~~

## Breakout
- **I think the answer here is repeated: Nothing would happen, there would just not be anything left to do if you reached it** ~~Game over? Could you ever win? ~~
- ~~How to handle the reset when someone misses? (See Pong above)~~
- ~~Add spin off the paddle~~
 
## Asteroids
- ~~Add a flame to the back of the player when accelerating (could tie to progress toward max velocity for visual effect? Can it be redish? If so should I have a highlight colour throughout for just one element? Ball, flame, something?)~~
- ~~Add timer~~
- ~~Player-asteroid collision~~
- ~~Improve asteroid velocity~~
- **Kind of a half-way thing... feeling slow but not so slow it's dumb** ~~Rotation in slow motion?~~
- **Created irregular polygonal asteroids and they're lovely** ~~Why do circular asteroids feel kind of dumb?~~
- ~~Player explosions that would look right in slow motion? Recompose player at death out of multiple triangles for instance? Sounds like a horrible math experience, but could be worthwhile. (Or maybe I just create a particle effect for it, a bit easier...)~~

- Improve hit zone stuff with player-asteroid collision (looks weird)
- Improve asteroid breakup positioning 
- Add timing limit to missiles (at least create the same spatial cap if you spam? How to signal the missile is not ready to fire? Attach it to the front of the ship all the time and fire? Something else?)

## Missile Command
- ~~Targeting the x is a bit off~~
- ~~Explosions aren't disappearing~~
- ~~Missiles appear inside launchers which looks stupid to my eye~~
- ~~Launcher shape? Check original game.~~
- **Better now but maybe not yet correct** What is the right speed for this thing?
- **And it's fairly beautiful** ~~Do get a line going behind the enemy missiles~~
- **Genius level: nothing happens until the timer runs down** Handling game over? 
- ~~Blue line for player misiles?~~

- Maximum number of missiles? I think so? - but then how to indicate?
