# Games

The point here is to have a place I can do some good old design thinking about specific games within the collection. As well as to come up with which games those might be.

## Pong

This is the one that starts it for me because I've advised students to try it out and I advise it in the current draft of the current book (*Playing the Variation Game*). In short: when I slow down the ball massively it feels like something.

One observation here is that I imagine slowing down the *ball* only, not the paddle, so that the player would still have immediate and "normal" agency in the sense of affecting something in play, but has to wait because there's a secondary object they are affecting.

That said, maybe there's room for that being a point of variation: *what* is slow.

I had a vision while sitting in this café (*Even*) of clouds slowly moving across the playfield for some reason and I kind of like it, but it's purely intuitive. I imagined it marking some kind of separate time, the clouds being faster than the ball and slower than the paddle. As well as perhaps being a repeated visual "refrain" across the games potentially. Though why?

There's a big question about AI here, or otherwise there's a big question about multiplayer.

## Breakout

Pretty similar to *Pong* ultimately, maybe not illustrating anything else? Well apart from the multiplayer bit, so maybe that's fine. 

The occurrence in *Breakout* where the ball gets up behind the bricks is interesting/potent in the context of slowness? 

## Snake

Party just because I already have an implementation? But also because it's pretty funny. BUT because Snake is tile-based, how do you control the snake? My assumption when I briefly thought about this was that there's an arrow in the snake's head pointing to the next direction and that's what you can change by pressing keys. Less immediacy of agency than the paddle in the other two, but not necessarily a bad thing?

## Asteroids

This is a nice one somehow, but what is slow? The ship *and* the asteroids? Only the ship's acceleration? Complexities in this one because of the freedom of movement? But I do like it in principle...

## Pac-Man

Kind of beautiful to imagine this one. Again either needs the arrow for changing direction per tile or something else?

## Space Invaders

Lovely. Slow invaders and slow bullets? And some kind of cool-down I guess right?

## Duck Hunt

Just because

## Tetris

This was on my original list... it seems like a pretty good one?

## Flappy bird

I wonder

## Chess

Have I already done this?

## Missile Command

Mostly here because it's a fairly simple game but I confess I don't really know if/how to create it.

## Frogger

Somehow feels like this "won't work" for reasons I'm not sure about... but maybe it would? Tile by tile movement right? Seems okay?
