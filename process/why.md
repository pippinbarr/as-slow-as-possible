# Why?

## #1 (2026-01-26)

I am making a set of classic simple physics-oriented games like *Pong*, *Breakout*, etc. in which the key element of play (the ball, say) moves incredibly slowly. 

I want to explore the feelings associated with playing a game like this, and in a perfect world end up with games that encourage a meditative state of detachment that gets that the idea – explored a bit in *It is as if you were on your phone* – that being locked into a screen-based videogame experience can be calming and therapeutic instead of immersive and depressing.

I am making four arcade games – versions of Pong, Breakout, Asteroids, and Missile Command – that each run incredibly slowly.

The point of this is to foreground the feeling of time passing during play, to play up and explore the tensions inherent in "ultra-slow arcade style play". My basic hypothesis is that it will *feel like something* to play games this way, though exactly how it will feel I'm less sure of. My first guesses right now revolve around the idea of it being "strangely" relaxing or calming; but also that there will be something to the key punctuating moments of play (ball hits paddle, brick disappears, asteroid explodes, missile tracks toward its target) played at this speed. The role of anticipation feels like it will be increased, and the balancing against/with boredom is something I'll be thinking about as well (as well as the eternal question: why would anyone actually play this and what is it reasonable to demand?) It could be that I'm subconsciously even making some arguments about how games "waste" our time with repetitive actions?
