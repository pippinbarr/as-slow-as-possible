# Why?

## #1 (2026-01-26)

I am making a set of classic simple physics-oriented games like *Pong*, *Breakout*, etc. in which the key element of play (the ball, say) moves incredibly slowly. 

I want to explore the feelings associated with playing a game like this, and in a perfect world end up with games that encourage a meditative state of detachment that gets that the idea – explored a bit in *It is as if you were on your phone* – that being locked into a screen-based videogame experience can be calming and therapeutic instead of immersive and depressing.
